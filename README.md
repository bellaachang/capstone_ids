# IDS Capstone Project: Assessing Professor Effectiveness (APE) with Data Science Methodologies
Authors: Bella Chang, Kristina Fujimoto, Emily Wang

## Overview 
This project explores gender bias in student evaluations of university professors using data from RateMyProfessor.com. We applied statistical analysis and machine learning to identify patterns related to gender, perceived difficulty, and qualitative teaching tags.

## Key Insights
- Male professors tend to receive slightly higher ratings
- Tags like “Hilarious” and “Amazing Lectures” show more gender bias than grading-related tags
- Difficulty ratings are not significantly different across genders
- Attractiveness (“pepper” status) is a strong predictor of rating

## How to Run

```bash
python gender_bias_rmp_analysis_restructured.py
```
